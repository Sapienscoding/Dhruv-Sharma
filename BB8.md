I along with my team made a spherical robot "BB8" and to enhance its usability and interactiveness we incorporated an open source AI voice assistant (MyCroft)
I worked on the locomotion part of the robot, which also included but was not limited to circuitry and stuff.
The code in this repository was used for its movement and it is written in Arduino IDE.
